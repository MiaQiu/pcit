Generate a JSON object with these fields. Be warm, specific, and use {{CHILD_NAME}} naturally. Avoid generic platitudes — ground everything in the actual data above.

{
  "headline": "A warm personal sentence summarizing the week, max 60 characters. Use the child's name. Example: 'Anya felt seen and safe in your play this week'",

  "parentGrowthNarrative": "One sentence that names the parent's emerging strength as an IDENTITY, connecting their strongest skill to how it impacts the child. NOT a stat — a statement about who they're becoming. Example: 'You're becoming a parent who narrates — and that's changing how Anya sees herself.'",

  "noraObservation": "2 sentences observing what the parent did DIFFERENTLY this week, grounded in the data. Not a tip — an observation. Reference specific skill patterns or shifts. Example: 'You used more echoes during transitions this week — moments when Anya usually struggles. That's exactly when being heard matters most.'",

  "childSpotlight": "2-3 sentences about the child's week, written like a teacher's warmest parent-conference observation. Use the child's name, reference specific behaviors observed. Focus on what the child SHOWED — engagement, language, emotions, social skills. Example: 'Zoey was expressive and engaged this week. She initiated play ideas twice, used longer sentences, and asked for your attention with words instead of grabbing.'",

  "growthSnapshots": [
    {
      "category": "Parent-friendly category name. Map: Language→'Words & Voice', Cognitive→'Thinking & Learning', Social→'Playing Together', Emotional→'Big Feelings', Connection→'Your Bond'",
      "icon": "Ionicon name: 'chatbubble' for Words & Voice, 'bulb' for Thinking & Learning, 'people' for Playing Together, 'heart' for Big Feelings, 'hand-left' for Your Bond",
      "childQuote": "The child's actual words or a brief behavioral description from the profiling evidence. Keep it short and vivid.",
      "meaning": "One warm sentence about what this behavior means developmentally, in parent-friendly language. No jargon."
    }
  ],

  "childProgressNote": "Optional one-liner comparing the child now vs. when they started, ONLY if earliest profiling data is available. Use child's name. Example: 'In your first week, Zoey used mostly single words. Now she's building 4-word sentences.' Return null if no earliest profiling data to compare.",

  "focusHeading": "Next week's actionable focus based on weakest area + clinical needs. One sentence, imperative. Example: 'Use narration during transitions'",

  "focusSubtext": "A warm grounding one-liner. Example: 'You don't need to be perfect — just consistent.'",

  "whyExplanation": "2-3 sentences explaining why the focus matters for THIS child specifically. Use child's name and reference clinical focus.",

  "trendMessage": "Frame the week-over-week comparison warmly. If deposits went up, celebrate. If down, normalize. If no previous data, encourage. Example: 'Your praise increased 40% — Anya noticed!'",

  "strongestGrowthArea": "The single most improved or strongest skill: 'Praise', 'Echo', or 'Narrate'",

  "childResponseSummary": "2 sentences synthesizing the child reaction patterns across sessions. Use child's name.",

  "consistencyMessage": "Practice consistency framed encouragingly. Example: 'You showed up 4 out of 7 days — that consistency matters!'"
}

IMPORTANT for growthSnapshots:
- Select 2-3 of the BEST child observations from the profiling data
- Translate clinical language into parent-friendly terms
- Use the child's actual words when available as childQuote
- If no profiling observations are available, create 2 snapshots based on child reactions data
- Each meaning should celebrate, not instruct

Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text.
