# Keyword Definitions Template

This template ensures consistency when adding new keyword definitions for the Nora app's interactive glossary feature.

## Format Rules

1. **Each keyword starts with `### [Keyword Term]`** (three hashtags)
2. **Definition follows immediately after** in plain text
3. **Use blank lines to separate keywords**
4. **Support markdown formatting** (bold with `**text**`, line breaks, etc.)
5. **Structure optional** - You can use subsections like "History:", "Key Concept:", etc. for clarity

## Template

```markdown
### [Keyword Term]

[Definition text here. Can be multiple paragraphs.]

[Optional structured sections:]
**History:** [Historical background]

**Key Concept:** [Core concept explanation]

**The Science:** [Scientific explanation]

**The Result:** [Practical outcome]

### [Next Keyword Term]

[Next definition...]
```

## Examples

### Attachment Theory

**History:** Developed by John Bowlby in the 1950s.

**Key Concept:** The "Secure Base." When a child feels a deep, safe bond with a parent, they gain the confidence to explore and the willingness to cooperate.

### Play Therapy

**History:** Established by pioneers like Virginia Axline in the 1940s.

**Key Concept:** "Play is a child's language." Toys are their words. By joining their play without directing it, you enter their world and build immediate trust.

### Executive Function

When you stay quiet, the child must plan and execute ideas themselves. You are building the part of the brain responsible for self-regulation and organization.

### Flow

A psychological state of deep immersion. Frequent questions break this state. Protecting "flow" builds a child's attention span.

## Guidelines

### DO:
- ✅ Use `###` before each keyword term
- ✅ Keep definitions clear and concise
- ✅ Use `**bold**` for emphasis
- ✅ Separate keywords with blank lines
- ✅ Use consistent structure for similar concepts
- ✅ Include practical explanations parents can understand

### DON'T:
- ❌ Mix different heading levels (stick to `###`)
- ❌ Use colons (`:`) in the keyword term itself
- ❌ Include the keyword term in the definition text
- ❌ Forget blank lines between keywords
- ❌ Use complex jargon without explanation
