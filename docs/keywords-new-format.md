---

### Attachment Theory

**History:** Developed by John Bowlby in the 1950s.

**Key Concept:** The "Secure Base." When a child feels a deep, safe bond with a parent, they gain the confidence to explore and the willingness to cooperate.

### Authoritative Parenting

**The Concept:** Widely considered the "gold standard" of parenting styles. It balances high responsiveness (warmth, connection, and empathy) with high demandingness (clear boundaries, expectations, and leadership). This approach fosters the highest levels of independence, self-reliance, and emotional regulation in children.

### Play Therapy

**History:** Established by pioneers like Virginia Axline in the 1940s.

**Key Concept:** "Play is a child's language." Toys are their words. By joining their play without directing it, you enter their world and build immediate trust.

### Triple P

**Full Name:** Positive Parenting Program

**History:** Created by Dr. Matt Sanders in the 1970s.

**Key Concept:** Self-regulation. We use warm, positive interactions to help children (and parents) manage their own emotions and behaviors effectively.

### Behavior Management

**History:** Rooted in Behavioral Science (B.F. Skinner).

**Key Concept:** Reinforcement. We focus on "catching them being good." Behavior that is positively noticed and reinforced is much more likely to be repeated.

### Emotional Bank Account

**History:** Originally popularized by Dr. Stephen Covey in the late 1980s, this concept is now a cornerstone of modern relationship psychology.

**The Concept:** It explains the "Connect before Discipline" strategy. By building a surplus of goodwill, you ensure your child has the "emotional funds" to follow a difficult instruction when you eventually have to give one.

### Cortisol vs. Oxytocin

**The Science:** Commands and "teaching moments" can trigger performance stress (Cortisol) in a child. Following their lead triggers Oxytocin (the bonding hormone).

**The Result:** Oxytocin physically relaxes the child's nervous system, making them more open to your influence later.

### Joint Attention

**The Science:** This is a high-level brain state where you and your child are perfectly "in sync" on a single task.

**The Result:** It is the most effective way to improve a child's focus, empathy, and long-term listening habits.

### Internal Locus of Control

**The Science:** By letting them "fail" or play "wrong" without correcting them, you allow them to solve their own problems.

**The Result:** This builds their belief that they are capable. It creates a child who is self-motivated rather than just "obedient."

### The VIP Strategy

Frame the 5 minutes as a "Special Date." Give other children a "Waiting Activity" (a special snack, a short video, or a specific solo toy). Explain that their VIP turn is coming next.

### Instruction Fatigue

Kids hear hundreds of commands daily and "tune out." A 5-minute break "resets" their brain, making your important safety instructions more impactful later.

### Executive Function

When you stay quiet, the child must plan and execute ideas themselves. You are building the part of the brain responsible for self-regulation and organization.

### Hidden Commands

**The Logic:** Questions that implicitly tell a child what to do or what to focus on.

**Example:** "Can you share?" is usually a command to share rather than a genuine inquiry.

### Flow

A psychological state of deep immersion. Frequent questions break this state. Protecting "flow" builds a child's attention span.

### Defense Mechanism

Correction can feel like personal rejection, triggering the "Fight or Flight" brain. Removing judgment keeps the child's "Social Engagement System" active.

### Safe Haven

In Attachment Theory, this is where a child goes for comfort. Accepting mistakes proves your love isn't conditional on them doing things "right."

### Follower Role

Adults almost always lead. Intentionally following gives the child a healthy sense of power, making them less likely to seek "unhealthy power" via tantrums.

### Self-Efficacy

**The Concept:** A child's belief in their own ability to succeed. It is built through specific feedback that highlights competence rather than just the final result.

### Reflective Listening

Repeating the child's words validates their perspective. It makes them feel heard and understood, which is the foundation of emotional intelligence.

### Shared Reality

When you narrate, you join their world. This state of "Joint Attention" is shown to improve language development and social bonding.

### Mental Gym

The concept that Special Time is a dedicated space for high-intensity relationship training. It separates "normal life" from "therapeutic play."

### Emotional Stamina

A child's ability to handle rules, boundaries, and "heavy" instructions without becoming defensive. This is built through consistent "deposits."

### Skill Density

A measure of how many positive techniques (Praise, Echo, Narrate) are used per minute. Higher density leads to faster bonding.

### Strategic Ignoring

A core technique in behavior management. By withdrawing attention from minor negative behaviors, you prevent them from being reinforced without having to use a "withdrawal" like a command or criticism.

### Extinction Burst

A psychological phenomenon where an unwanted behavior increases in intensity or frequency when it is first ignored. It is a sign that the old behavior pattern is breaking down.

### Differential Reinforcement

The process of reinforcing one set of behaviors (positive play) while ignoring others (whining). This is the most effective way to shape long-term behavior without conflict.

### Redirection

**Definition:** The act of guiding a child from an inappropriate behavior to an appropriate one by providing a safe alternative or modeling the correct way to interact.

### Session End Logic

**The Logic:** In Nora, the highest reward is your undivided attention. If safety is compromised, that reward is immediately removed.

**The Result:** This is a non-confrontational way to set a firm boundary.

### Natural Consequence

**The Concept:** An outcome that happens naturally without a parent having to "enforce" a punishment. If the play is destructive, the fun ends.

### Safety Response

**The Metric:** A metric measuring the parent's ability to remain calm and neutral while setting boundaries during rough play.

### Co-Regulation

**The Concept:** The process where a caregiver stays calm and regulated to help a child's nervous system settle down. By staying quiet during a child's "downstairs brain" moment, you provide the safety they need to return to a calm state.

**The Logic:** Children cannot self-regulate until they have experienced consistent co-regulation from a calm adult.

### Mirror Neurons

**The Science:** Brain cells that react both when an individual performs an action and when they witness someone else perform it.

**The Result:** Your child "feels" your calmness or stress through these neurons, making your internal state contagious.

### Emotional Anchor

**The Concept:** Being the steady point of safety for a child during emotional storms.

**The Result:** Using a calm, warm voice during P.E.N. skills acts as a tether that keeps the child from drifting into defiance.

### The Mental Reset

**The Logic:** A brief ritual (like deep breathing) to transition from a stressful adult world to the child's play world.

**The Result:** It prevents "spillover stress" from ruining the 5-minute connection deposit.

### Attunement

**The Science:** A state of "being at one" with another person.

**The Result:** When you are attuned, your responses perfectly match the child's needs, creating a sense of deep safety.

### Voice Tonality

**Definition:** A metric measuring the warmth, pitch, and pace of the parent's voice.

**The Result:** Warm tonality is the primary signal of safety for a child's nervous system.

### Labeled Praise

**The Logic:** Praise that specifies exactly what behavior is being admired. It is the most powerful form of positive reinforcement because it removes the guesswork for the child.

### Unlabeled Praise

**The Logic:** Generic positive comments like "Good job" or "Nice." While positive, they don't provide the "why," making them significantly less effective at shaping behavior.

### Clear Guidance

**The Concept:** Providing explicit information on which actions are successful. This reduces anxiety and increases the likelihood that positive behavior will be repeated.

### Validation

**The Logic:** The psychological act of recognizing and accepting a child's effort. It builds trust and makes the child feel truly "seen," which is the core of the Nora method.

### Verbal Hug

**The Logic:** A metaphor for the emotional warmth provided by echoing. It makes a child feel supported and understood, reinforcing the safety of the interaction.

### Language Modeling

**The Science:** A technique where the parent repeats a child's statement using correct grammar. It provides a non-corrective way for children to learn linguistic structures without feeling criticized.

### Energy Matching

**The Logic:** Aligning your tone and enthusiasm with the child's emotional state. This ensures your responses feel authentic and empathetic rather than robotic.

### After-School Interrogation

**The Logic:** The tendency for parents to flood a child with questions immediately after school.

**The Result:** Because children are often mentally drained, these questions feel like a demand for more "work."

### Interrogation Mode

**The Concept:** A state where a parent asks too many questions, making the interaction feel like an interview. This creates performance anxiety.

### Reflector Role

**The Logic:** The parent's job to mirror the child's actions and words through Narration and Echoing. This ensures the child feels truly "seen."

### Performance Pressure

**The Result:** The feeling a child gets when they feel they must give the "right" answer. Avoiding questions removes this pressure.

### Safe Landing

**The Logic:** Providing a calm, low-pressure physical and emotional space for a child to transition back to the home environment.

### Connection Surge

**The Concept:** The spontaneous moment when a child feels secure enough to begin sharing thoughts and feelings voluntarily.

### Active Silence

**The Strategy:** The intentional choice to avoid asking questions or leading the conversation. This creates a psychological "vacuum" that invites the child to speak.

### Negative Attention Trap

**The Logic:** Children crave attention so much they will take "bad" attention over none at all. Correcting behavior during play unintentionally rewards that behavior.

### Self-Esteem Impact

**The Science:** Constant correction can make a child feel incompetent.

**The Result:** By removing criticism for 5 minutes, you give their self-esteem a "boost."

### Proactive Discipline

**The Concept:** A style of parenting where boundaries are set clearly and calmly before a crisis occurs. It focuses on teaching rather than punishment.

### Guardrail Logic

**The Logic:** A metaphor explaining that boundaries are protective, not restrictive.

**The Result:** Just as guardrails keep a car safe, firm discipline keeps a child safe within social rules.

### Safe Withdrawal

**The Logic:** In the Nora method, a command or consequence is a "withdrawal" from the relationship's trust.

**The Result:** If the account is full, the child can "afford" to follow instructions without feeling rejected.

### Granular Instructions

**The Logic:** Breaking a large task into one single, observable step. This respects the child's developing "Executive Function."

### Neutral Voice

**The Concept:** A calm, matter-of-fact tone. It signals confidence and leadership without triggering "fight or flight."

### Instruction Noise

**The Result:** The mental clutter created when a parent adds reasons or extra words into a command. This makes it harder for the child to isolate the specific action.

### The 5-Second Rule

**The Logic:** Silent counting in your head (1... 2... 3... 4... 5) after a command. This gives the child's brain the necessary "latency" time to act.

### Labeled Praise for Minding

**The Concept:** A specific praise that emphasizes the act of listening.

**Example:** "Thank you for listening the first time!"

### Dawdling

**The Logic:** Any behavior that does not involve physical movement toward obeying. In the Nora method, 5 seconds of dawdling equals disobedience.

### The Warning Bridge

**The Concept:** A single, clear "If-Then" statement given after a child fails to follow an initial command. It provides a final opportunity to self-correct.

### Removal of Privileges

**The Logic:** For older children, the loss of screen time or a toy acts as the "withdrawal" of attention and fun.

### Break from Attention

**The Logic:** In Nora, your undivided attention is the highest reward.

**The Result:** A "break" means removing eye contact and play, allowing the child's brain to cool down.

### Practice Command

**The Strategy:** A simple, easy-to-follow instruction given during a positive moment. It allows for practice without a high risk of struggle.

### Success Cycle

**The Logic:** The positive loop of a clear command followed by immediate praise for minding.

### Marking Success

**The Logic:** Using your attention to "highlight" a good choice. By marking compliance with praise, you ensure the brain registers the positive outcome.

### Physical Prompt

**The Strategy:** Using a non-verbal cue, such as pointing or gesturing, to help a child process a command.

### Natural Reward

**The Result:** A positive outcome that happens naturally when a child follows directions quickly, such as having more time for fun.

### Public Testing Trap

**The Logic:** When a child realizes the parent is too embarrassed to follow through in public, leading to increased defiance.

### Consistency Chain

**The Logic:** The unwavering link between a behavior and its result. Consistency is the fastest way to improve long-term cooperation.

### Attention Wall

**The Concept:** The mental barrier a parent maintains during a consequence.

**The Result:** Removing all eye contact and verbal responses to ensure zero reinforcement for defiant behavior.

### Self-Regulation Training

**The Science:** The process of a child learning to manage their own intense emotions. This is only possible in a consistent, calm environment.

### Emotional Hangover

**The Logic:** The internal guilt parents feel after enforcing a boundary. Recognizing this helps parents stay consistent.

### Clean Slate Logic

**The Concept:** The principle that once a consequence ends, the conflict is over. No lingering resentment or shaming.

### Intermittent Reinforcement

**The Science:** A schedule where a behavior is only rewarded or enforced some of the time. This makes a behavior much harder to stop.

### Pure P.E.N. Play

**The Strategy:** Returning to a 100% child-led environment with zero instructions.

### Whole-Brain Connection

**The Concept:** Connect with the child's emotional state before using logic or discipline.

**The Result:** Ensures the child is neurologically capable of listening.

### Upstairs Brain

**The Science:** The cerebral cortex, responsible for high-level thinking, empathy, and impulse control. It is under construction until the mid-20s.

### Downstairs Brain

**The Science:** The limbic system and brainstem, responsible for survival (fight/flight/freeze) and strong emotions.

### Shark Music

**The Concept:** The internal anxieties parents carry that cloud their ability to see their child's actual needs.

### Mindful Leadership

**The Strategy:** The practice of pausing to separate your own emotional state from the child's behavior.

### House Rules

**The Strategy:** A specialized discipline tool for aggressive or destructive behaviors.

**The Result:** Rules are pre-taught and enforced immediately to provide maximum clarity.

### No-Drama Script

**The Concept:** Using the absolute minimum amount of words during a consequence to prevent an emotional power struggle.
