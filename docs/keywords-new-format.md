### Attachment Theory

**History:** Developed by John Bowlby in the 1950s.

**Key Concept:** The "Secure Base." When a child feels a deep, safe bond with a parent, they gain the confidence to explore and the willingness to cooperate.

### Play Therapy

**History:** Established by pioneers like Virginia Axline in the 1940s.

**Key Concept:** "Play is a child's language." Toys are their words. By joining their play without directing it, you enter their world and build immediate trust.

### Triple P

**Full Name:** Positive Parenting Program

**History:** Created by Dr. Matt Sanders in the 1970s.

**Key Concept:** Self-regulation. We use warm, positive interactions to help children (and parents) manage their own emotions and behaviors effectively.

### Behavior Management

**History:** Rooted in Behavioral Science (B.F. Skinner).

**Key Concept:** Reinforcement. We focus on "catching them being good." Behavior that is positively noticed and reinforced is much more likely to be repeated.

### Emotional Bank Account

**History:** Originally popularized by Dr. Stephen Covey in the late 1980s, this concept is now a cornerstone of modern relationship psychology.

**The Concept:** It explains the "Connect before Discipline" strategy. By building a surplus of goodwill, you ensure your child has the "emotional funds" to follow a difficult instruction when you eventually have to give one.

### Cortisol vs. Oxytocin

**The Science:** Commands and "teaching moments" can trigger performance stress (Cortisol) in a child. Following their lead triggers Oxytocin (the bonding hormone).

**The Result:** Oxytocin physically relaxes the child's nervous system, making them more open to your influence later.

### Joint Attention

**The Science:** This is a high-level brain state where you and your child are perfectly "in sync" on a single task.

**The Result:** It is the most effective way to improve a child's focus, empathy, and long-term listening habits.

### Internal Locus of Control

**The Science:** By letting them "fail" or play "wrong" without correcting them, you allow them to solve their own problems.

**The Result:** This builds their belief that they are capable. It creates a child who is self-motivated rather than just "obedient."

### The VIP Strategy

Frame the 5 minutes as a "Special Date." Give other children a "Waiting Activity" (a special snack, a short video, or a specific solo toy). Explain that their VIP turn is coming next.

### Instruction Fatigue

Kids hear hundreds of commands daily and "tune out." A 5-minute break "resets" their brain, making your important safety instructions more impactful later.

### Executive Function

When you stay quiet, the child must plan and execute ideas themselves. You are building the part of the brain responsible for self-regulation and organization.

### Hidden Commands

Most parent questions are actually "tests" that take the lead away from the child. Avoiding them allows for child-led, collaborative play.

### Flow

A psychological state of deep immersion. Frequent questions break this state. Protecting "flow" builds a child's attention span.

### Defense Mechanism

Correction can feel like personal rejection, triggering the "Fight or Flight" brain. Removing judgment keeps the child's "Social Engagement System" active.

### Safe Haven

In Attachment Theory, this is where a child goes for comfort. Accepting mistakes proves your love isn't conditional on them doing things "right."

### Follower Role

Adults almost always lead. Intentionally following gives the child a healthy sense of power, making them less likely to seek "unhealthy power" via tantrums.

### Self-Efficacy

The belief in one's own ability to succeed. Specific praise is the most powerful way to build this in children under 7.

### Reflective Listening

Repeating the child's words validates their perspective. It makes them feel heard and understood, which is the foundation of emotional intelligence.

### Shared Reality

When you narrate, you join their world. This state of "Joint Attention" is shown to improve language development and social bonding.

### Mental Gym

The concept that Special Time is a dedicated space for high-intensity relationship training. It separates "normal life" from "therapeutic play."

### Emotional Stamina

A child's ability to handle rules, boundaries, and "heavy" instructions without becoming defensive. This is built through consistent "deposits."

### Skill Density

A measure of how many positive techniques (Praise, Echo, Narrate) are used per minute. Higher density leads to faster bonding.

### Strategic Ignoring

A core technique in behavior management. By withdrawing attention from minor negative behaviors, you prevent them from being reinforced without having to use a "withdrawal" like a command or criticism.

### Extinction Burst

A psychological phenomenon where an unwanted behavior increases in intensity or frequency when it is first ignored. It is a sign that the old behavior pattern is breaking down.

### Differential Reinforcement

The process of reinforcing one set of behaviors (positive play) while ignoring others (whining). This is the most effective way to shape long-term behavior without conflict.
