Part I: Introduction & Foundations


Welcome to Pocket PCIT

Pocket PCIT is a resource based on Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), an evidence-based treatment for children (ages 2-7) with disruptive behaviors. This program provides tips to improve your relationship with your child and improve your child's behavior.
Note: This resource is not meant to replace therapy for children with significant behavior problems. It is meant to support you in practicing skills. If you need a therapist, please visit PCIT.org.

What is PCIT?

PCIT happens in two phases. You must master the first phase before moving to the second.
Child-Directed Interaction (CDI): The "Relationship" Phase. You learn to pay attention to positive behaviors (like gentle hands) and ignore unwanted minor behaviors (whining). This makes the child want to please you more often.
Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI): The "Discipline" Phase. Once the relationship is strong, you learn effective discipline techniques to teach your child to obey.

Why Should I Change the Way I Parent?

Parents often ask why they must change for their child's behavior to improve. The reality is that YOU are the most important ingredient to your child’s success.
Goodness of Fit: What worked for your other children might not work for this child. Some children are naturally more strong-willed. You must adjust your parenting style to match your child's temperament.
The "Phase" Myth: Research shows that children with behavior problems often continue to have them unless the family gets help. Early intervention prevents larger problems (school failure, delinquency) later in life.
Relationship Building: If you feel your child "doesn't like you," it is often because they lack emotional control or have learned that negative statements get your attention. PCIT changes this dynamic.

How Can You Influence Behavior?

Behaviors that are rewarded happen more often. Behaviors that are ignored happen less often.
1. Rewards (To increase good behavior)
Social: Praise, smiles, looking/listening.
Material: Small toys, stickers, treats.
Activities: Reading together, going to the park.
2. Negative Consequences (To decrease bad behavior)
Active Ignoring: Removing all attention (no eye contact, no talking) for minor misbehaviors.
Natural Consequences: Allowing a safe event to happen (e.g., "Because you broke the toy, you cannot play with it").
Time Out: Used in the PDI phase for non-compliance.


Part II: Child-Directed Interaction (CDI)

Goal: enhance positive interactions and reduce negative attention-seeking behaviors.

The PRIDE Skills

Use these skills during "Special Time" and throughout the day to make your child feel good and behave better.
P (Praising):
Labeled Praise: Be specific. Instead of "Good job," say "I like the way you drew that circle!" or "Thank you for sitting quietly." This tells the child exactly what to do again.
R (Reflecting):
Repeat or paraphrase what your child says.
Child: "I drive the car." -> Parent: "You are driving the red car fast!"
This shows you are listening and helps language development.
I (Imitating):
Do what your child is doing. If they build a tower, you build a tower.
This shows approval of their play and teaches them how to play cooperatively.
D (Describing):
Act like a sports broadcaster. Describe what the child is doing.
"You are putting the blue block on top."
This holds the child's attention and teaches concepts.
E (Enjoyment):
Show enthusiasm! Smile, use a warm tone.

The "Don't" Skills (Avoid these during Special Time)

Avoid Commands: Do not tell the child what to do (e.g., "Put that there," "Don't do that"). Commands can lead to conflict. In CDI, the child leads.
Avoid Questions: Questions (e.g., "What color is that?") are often hidden commands testing the child. They interrupt the child's play flow. Instead, use Descriptions ("That is a red block").
Avoid Criticism: Words like "No," "Don't," "Stop," or "That's wrong" lower self-esteem and make the interaction negative.

Active Ignoring

Ignore minor misbehaviors (whining, pouting, baby talk) to make them go away.
How to do it: Turn your face away, avoid eye contact, and stay silent.
When to stop: The second the bad behavior stops, return your attention immediately and give a PRIDE skill (e.g., "I love how you are using your big boy voice now!").

Daily Practice: Special Time

You must practice these skills for 5 minutes every day.
Set Up: Pick a time and a quiet place.
Toys: Choose creative toys (blocks, Legos, crayons). Avoid violent toys (guns, swords) or rule-based games (board games, video games) which cause conflict.
Action: Say, "It is time for special time! I'm going to play with you and you can be the boss." Use your PRIDE skills heavily.


Part III: Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI)

Important: Do not start PDI until you are comfortable with CDI. PDI teaches a specific discipline sequence to handle disobedience.

Giving Effective Commands

To help your child obey, you must give commands correctly.
Direct: Say "Please hand me the block" (Command) rather than "Will you hand me the block?" (Question).
Positive: Say what to do, not what not to do. (e.g., "Walk please" instead of "Don't run").
Specific: Be clear. "Put your shoes in the box."
One at a time: Don't string commands together.
Normal Tone: Don't yell; be calm and firm.
Developmentally Appropriate: Ensure the child understands and is capable of the task.

The Command Sequence (PDI Protocol)

Step 1: The Command Give a direct, effective command. Wait 5 seconds silently. (Count in your head).
Step 2: The Reaction
If Child Obeys: Give a Labeled Praise immediately. ("Thank you for listening to mommy right away!") -> Interaction Ends successfully.
If Child Disobeys: Proceed to the Chair Warning.
Step 3: The Chair Warning If the child does not obey within 5 seconds, give the warning using these exact words:
"If you don't [repeat original command], you will have to sit on the time-out chair."
Wait 5 seconds silently.
Step 4: The Reaction to Warning
If Child Obeys: Give a Labeled Praise. ("Thank you for listening.") -> Interaction Ends.
If Child Disobeys: Proceed to Time Out.
Step 5: The Time Out If the child does not obey the warning, take them to the chair. Say these exact words:
"You didn't do what I told you to do, so you have to sit on the time-out chair."
The Rule: The child must stay on the chair for 3 minutes PLUS 5 seconds of quiet.
Say: "Stay on the chair until I say you can get off."
Ignore any talking, shouting, or pleading while they are on the chair.
Step 6: Post-Time Out After the time is up (and they have been quiet for 5 seconds), ask: "Are you ready to do what I said?"
If yes: Go back to the task.
The Follow-Through: You must return to the original command. Say: "Please [original command]."
When they do it, say: "Thank you for listening." (Do not be overly enthusiastic here; keep it neutral).

Troubleshooting Time Out

Escapes: If the child gets off the chair before time is up:
Put them back on the chair.
Say: "You got off the chair before I said you could, so your time-out starts over again. Stay on the chair until I say you can get off."
Restart the timer (3 mins + 5 sec quiet).
Public Places: You must have a plan for public time-outs (e.g., a specific spot in the car or a corner of the store).


Part IV: Advanced Application


Structuring the Environment

House Rules: Set up clear rules for the home.
Routine: Keep PDI practice consistent.

Managing Behaviors in Public

Prepare: Before leaving, tell the child the rules and the reward for good behavior.
Praise: Praise the child in public for staying close, using inside voices, etc.
Plan: Know where you will do a time-out if necessary.

Graduation

You are ready to "graduate" from Pocket PCIT when:
You use PRIDE skills naturally throughout the day.
Your child obeys commands quickly.
Your relationship feels stronger and less stressful.
